          <p>You can use Seenapse when you're a bit stuck, or in a hurry,
            or simply when you want to benefit from diverse ways of looking
            at the creative problem you're working on.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Which is pretty much always, in our experience.</p>

        <h2>How to use Seenapse</h2>

        <br>

        <p>Using Seenapse is easy: if you are working with something related
            to, let's say, coffee, just type in "coffee" in the search box.
            Each of the results can lead you to interesting, divergent stuff
            that people like you from all over the world have seenapsed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The most important thing to keep in mind is this: what you
              find in Seenapse won't be the solution to your problem, but it
              will inspire you to come up with it. So don't just look at the
              seenapses, go deeper and think how do they relate to the problem,
              and then the solution will pop up in your mind.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Also, whenever you see a seenapse and think,
                "oh, this reminds me of this other thing", go ahead and
                seenapse it. In this way you'll be giving back to the other
                seenapsersâ€”and when they seenapse stuff to yours, they will
                help you take your thinking in new directions. Everyone wins.</p>
